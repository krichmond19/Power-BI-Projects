# Power_BI
Power BI project using Power Query and DAX

I have created a dashboard for Adventure Works, a global manufacturing company using PowerBI Desktop to track KPIs (Sales, Revenue, Profit and Returns), compared regional performance, analyzed product-level trends and forecasts by using raw CSV files containing information about transactions, returns, products and regions.

Steps followed to build dashboard :
- Connecting Data with Power BI Desktop. 
- Data Cleaning using Power Query Editor.
- Build a relational data model.
- Create new calculated columns and DAX measures.
- Design an interactive report to analyze and visualize the data.
